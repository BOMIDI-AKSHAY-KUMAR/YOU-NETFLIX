Joe's bookstore (first season)
The first season follows the story of Joe Goldberg, a bookstore manager in New York, who upon meeting Guinevere Beck, an aspiring writer, becomes infatuated with her. He feeds his obsession using social media and other technology to track her presence and watch her in her house and remove obstacles to their romance including her friends and ex-boyfriend.

In the second season, Joe Goldberg moves from New York to Los Angeles to escape his past and starts over with a new identity to avoid his ex-girlfriend Candace who seeks revenge for burying her alive prior to season 1. When he meets avid chef Love Quinn, Joe begins falling into his old patterns of obsession and violence. As Joe attempts to forge a new love, he strives to make his relationship with Love succeed at all costs to avoid the fate of his past romantic endeavors. Unbeknownst to him, Love has dark secrets herself.

In the third season, Joe and Love are married and raising their newborn son, Henry, in the Californian suburb of Madre Linda. As their relationship dynamic takes a new turn, Joe continues to repeat the cycle of obsession with a burgeoning interest in Natalie, the next door neighbor, and local librarian Marienne. This time, Love ensures that her dream of having the perfect family will not be torn away so easily by Joe's compulsive actions.

In the fourth season, Joe Goldberg, posing as Jonathan Moore, is now residing in London, working as an English professor at a respected university, and leading a sedate existence. He has also been following Marienne around Europe in an attempt to locate her. His new life of solitude, however, is disrupted when he begins to bond with a circle of wealthy socialites, who begin to die off one by one as a serial murderer begins to target their elite group. Joe reverts to his old habits when he is pinned with evidence and blackmailed by the killer, who plays mind games with his subconscious. While trying to keep his true identity hidden from the group and working to catch the killer, Joe develops feelings for another woman named Kate.
